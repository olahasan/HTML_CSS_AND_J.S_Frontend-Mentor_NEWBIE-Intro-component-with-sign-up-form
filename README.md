## Overview

### The challenge

Practice building out a sign-up form complete with client-side validation using JavaScript.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
- Any input field is empty
- The email address is not formatted correctly
